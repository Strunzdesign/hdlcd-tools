How to install the additional tools for the HDLC Daemon
===

Initial download and setup on GNU/Linux:
---
Preparations:
- Install the "GCC toolchain"
- Install the "Boost Libraries"
- Install the "CMake" build system

To compile the HDLC daemon tools, just follow these steps:
1.) git clone --recursive https://github.com/Strunzdesign/hdlcd-tools.git
2.) cd hdlcd-tools
3.) mkdir build
4.) cd build
5.) cmake ..
6.) make
7.) make install (as root)

All binaries will be installed to "/usr/local/bin/".



Initial download and setup on Microsoft Windows 7:
---
Preparations:
- Download the latest "nuwen MinGW" distribution from https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
- Assure that you pick a MinGW distribution that already includes "Git" and the "Boost Libraries"
- Follow the installation guide, e.g., unpack MinGW to C:\MinGW
- Add MinGW to the path according to the installation guide
- Download and install "CMake" from https://cmake.org/download

To compile and install the HDLC daemon tools, just follow these steps:
1.) Go to your projects' folder and open a shell there
2.) git clone --recursive https://github.com/Strunzdesign/hdlcd-tools.git
3.) cd hdlcd-tools
4.) mkdir build
5.) cd build
6.) Pick yourself a directory to install the compiled files, e.g., consider C:\hdlcd-tools
7.) cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/c/hdlcd-tools ..
8.) If you get an error message on step 8, repeat step 8 once
9.) make
10.) make install

The "hdlcd-tools" binaries will be installed to "C:\hdlcd-tools\bin\" if not specified differently.



Update and recompile your local repository (same for all OS):
---
1.) cd hdlcd-tools
2.) git pull
3.) git submodule update
4.) cd build
5.) make
6.) make install

Have fun :-)
